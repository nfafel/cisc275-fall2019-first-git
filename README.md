1. Create java files to make this code compile and run.

2. What five objects are created in the main?

The five objects created in the main are one object that is an instance of the ArrayList class, three objects that are instances of the Dog class, and one object that is an instance of the Comparator class. 
 
3. Can you spot the Comparator constructor call? Where is the class definition for the Comparator?

The Comparator constructor is called on line 16 by the code: 'new Comparator\<Animal\>()'. The class definition for the Comparator is the lines of code that starts directly after the new keyword on line 16 and ends on line 21.
